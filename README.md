Static web pages in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I took this class in Fall 2016. Each folder is its own project/exercise. The final project was a simple personal website that I finished over a weekend with ASCII Art being the theme and motivation. Feel free to clone this repository and to explore the websites.
